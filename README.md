'HABs_Cyanobacteria_V4.fasta' - contains the V4 sequences of the phylum Cyanobacteria depostited into SILVA and accessed February 2021
<br/>
<br/>
'Split_Competitive_mcy_databaseA.fasta', 'Split_Competitive_mcy_databaseB.fasta', 'Split_Competitive_mcy_databaseC.fasta' - contains all sequences of mcy genes publically available on IMG/JGI accessed February 2021 including sequences from closely related cyanobacteria to maintain competitive mapping. The file database is broken into 3 files due to it's large size. To use, the three files should be concatenated together into a single file for BLAST analysis.
